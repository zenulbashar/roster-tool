# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repo. Keep this file
current as conventions and architecture evolve.

## What this is

A dead-simple roster (staff scheduling) tool for small, non-technical business
owners (cafés, restaurants). Mobile-first, high-contrast, zero jargon. Every
screen should be understandable in 5 seconds by someone who has never used
scheduling software.

## Product scope (MVP — do not exceed without flagging)

In scope: owner sign-up + business, add staff, shift templates, roster periods,
availability requests via staff magic links, availability summary, roster
builder, publish (personal emails + read-only shareable view), one automatic
reminder before the deadline.

**Out of scope (post-MVP):** SMS/WhatsApp, payroll, time clocking, free-text
reply parsing, billing, native apps, shift-swap workflows. If a request drifts
here, flag it rather than silently building it.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (migrations in `drizzle/`)
- Auth.js (`next-auth@5`) — owner auth via **email magic link**
- Email: Resend in production; Mailpit (local SMTP catcher) in development.
  Selected by `EMAIL_TRANSPORT` (`smtp` | `resend`).
- pg-boss — Postgres-backed background jobs
- Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first config in `src/app/globals.css`)
- Vitest — unit + integration tests
- pino — structured logging

## Key product decisions

- **Shifts**: business defines reusable **shift templates** (label + start/end +
  weekday flags). Creating a roster period expands templates into concrete
  shifts per day.
- **Availability**: per-shift yes/no (Available / Not available). 1:1 mapping to
  assignments.
- **Owner auth**: email magic link. First sign-in creates the Business.

## Non-negotiable conventions

### Multi-tenancy

- Every domain row carries `business_id`.
- `business_id` is ALWAYS derived from the authenticated session (owner) or a
  validated scoped token (staff). **Never** trust a client-supplied
  `business_id` from body/query/params.
- All domain reads/writes go through the tenant-scoped data-access layer in
  `src/lib/tenant/`. Don't query domain tables directly from routes.

### Time

- Store all timestamps in UTC.
- Display in the business timezone (default `Australia/Sydney`).
- Dates shown DD/MM. Use helpers in `src/lib/time.ts`; don't hand-roll
  formatting.
- Calendar dates (shift dates) and wall-clock times are stored as
  `YYYY-MM-DD` / `HH:MM` strings, not timestamps.

### Security

- Validate ALL external input with zod.
- Staff magic-link tokens are single-use-ish, scoped, and time-limited. Store
  only a **hash** of the token; compare hashes. Never log tokens or PII.
- Secrets live in env only, accessed via the validated `src/lib/env.ts`.

### Background jobs

- All email sending (availability requests, reminders, published rosters) goes
  through pg-boss jobs.
- Jobs MUST be idempotent and safe to retry.

### Observability

- Use the `logger` from `src/lib/logger.ts`. Structured logs only.
- No swallowed errors. Let jobs fail (so pg-boss retries) rather than catching
  and ignoring.

### UI / accessibility

- Semantic HTML, keyboard navigable, visible focus, WCAG AA contrast.
- Mobile-first. Minimal component set; no heavy UI kit.

## Running things

See README.md. Quick reference:

```bash
npm run dev:setup   # docker compose up + migrate + seed
npm run dev         # app
npm run worker      # background jobs
npm run db:generate # create migration from schema diff
npm run db:migrate  # apply migrations
npm run db:seed     # demo data
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR: `npm ci`, migrate (against a
Postgres service), typecheck, lint, format check, test. Keep it green.

## Working method

- Small, reviewable commits — one logical change each.
- Write tests alongside features.
- Update this file and README milestone checklist as things land.

## Data model

`business`, `user` (owner) + Auth.js tables, `staff_member`, `shift_template`,
`roster_period`, `shift`, `availability_request`, `availability_response`,
`roster_assignment`, `published_roster`. All domain tables are business-scoped.
